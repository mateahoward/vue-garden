## üîç Project uses:
- Vue 3 (3.2.0 beta)

## ‚úçÔ∏è Project Description:
This is a project I'm building for fun, the goal is to create your own farm which features: 

- Veg Garden with plots,seeds and farming jobs
- Tree Orchid with trees, fruits and harvesting jobs
- Animal Pen with piggies and food to feed them with

** Main farm items such as plots/seeds/piggies/etc are made with CSS only. As the project progresses I'll be replacing non-css items, such as backgrounds, with new CSS ones.
