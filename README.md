# 💛 Digital Farm made with Vue 

## ✍️ Project Description:
This is a project I'm building for fun, the goal is to create your own farm which features: 

- Vegetable Garden with drag & drop plots, seeds and farming jobs
- Tree Orchid with trees, fruits and harvesting jobs
- Animal Pen with piggies and food to feed them with

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main farm items such as plots/seeds/piggies/etc are made with CSS only. <br> 
As the project progresses I'll be replacing non-css items, such as backgrounds, with new CSS ones.
